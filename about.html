			<h1> About KoKoro Collective CIC</h1><br>
	<a>Kokoro Collective is focused on meeting the needs and demands of the people within
the ruralities of Herefordshire and Worcestershire.<br>
Kokoro is a Japanese word which translates into English as; ’Mind, Body and Soul’. <br>
This is essentially the service that the practitioners of Kokoro provide which offer a broad array of well-being treatments. This comes under the banner of “Social Prescribing.”<br>

Our aim is to offer well-being events for all of the community, supporting the loneliness and isolation projects currently running for people suffering with chronic illness or disabilities, physically or mentally. Once we are free from Lockdown we will be holding events at Village Halls, Community Halls and Churches with aspirations towards signposting and working alongside other agencies within the area. <br>
<!--The nucleus of Kokoro Collective is love and positivity reaching out to the community with empathy and compassion. To build a strong community offering hope and togetherness, through alternative therapies. To bring inclusivity to the community by offering jobs to the voluntary sector. Our uniqueness is that we have multiple disciplines of therapies together with the animals and sensory garden areas. This is a service like no other currently available and we believe this holistic approach to social prescribing will pay dividends.</a>
The services offered are:
Reiki, Animal Therapy, Hairdressing, Swedish massage, Dog grooming, Horse Lessons,
Meditation, Crystal Healing, Story Telling, Gardening lessons, Sensory gardens,
Acupuncture, Hypnotherapy, Music lessons, Reflexology, Art classes, Children's crafts,
British Sign Language Courses, Animal Care Courses, Mentoring, CBT Counselling,
Relationship Counselling and Fitness advice.</a>-->
